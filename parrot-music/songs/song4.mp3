The file /parrot-music-site/parrot-music-site/songs/song4.mp3 is intended to contain an audio track. However, as a text-based assistant, I cannot generate binary audio files directly. You will need to create or obtain an MP3 file for "song4" and place it in the specified directory.

Please ensure that you have an appropriate MP3 file named "song4.mp3" and place it in the /parrot-music-site/parrot-music-site/songs/ directory.
